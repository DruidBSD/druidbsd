The files in this directory [and subsequent sub-directories] are not direct-
dependencies to Druid but rather the source-dependencies required to build the
necessary FreeBSD elements of the Druid source itself.

For example, the sources required to build the file:

	mdroot/boot/mfsroot.gz

are located in the `mfsroot' sub-directory of this directory.
